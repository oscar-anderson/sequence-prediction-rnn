# Stock Price Prediction with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## Overview
This project constitutes a Python-based implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for predicting day closing Google stock prices from historical sequential time series data. The script first loads the historical stock price data from a CSV file, preprocesses this dataset, trains an RNN model and evaluates its performance on test data. The model architecture consists of a SimpleRNN layer followed by a Dense layer.
